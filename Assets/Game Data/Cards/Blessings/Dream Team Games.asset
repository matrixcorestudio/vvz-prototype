  description: "For  the next 10 rounds, the nearest opossing Viking becomes your
    ally. Whenever you step into each other when moving, both gain +1 PP, if either
    land on their ally, both gain +2 PP and remove each other negative status effect.
    When either player draws from a deck, the other player draws too from the same
    deck. When either player\u2019s Viking or Zombie respawns or is killed, the other
    player\u2019s respawns/dies too. Both players win the game if either Viking escapes.
    Both players lose if either Viking loses all stocks."
